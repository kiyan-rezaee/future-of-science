# Trend Prediction in the Scientific Community

## Project Objective
Identifying interdisciplinary connections can be pivotal for groundbreaking research. Nobel Prize-winning articles often tackle big, complex questions by combining insights from multiple fields. This project aims to identify potential fields of study that haven’t been extensively explored together. By predicting links between fields of study, researchers can explore new interdisciplinary opportunities that may lead to impactful discoveries.

In this project, we use machine learning techniques on time-aware graph data to predict unpaired links between nodes, where each node represents a field of study. The results can guide researchers toward promising areas for high-impact and innovative research.

## Project Phases

1. **Planning**: 
   - Define objectives and scope.
   - Gather and preprocess time-aware graph data representing fields of study.

2. **Development**: 
   - Implement graph-based machine learning models for link prediction (Baseline models).
   - Develop data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines.
   
3. **Testing**: 
   - Validate model predictions on historical data.
   - Perform evaluation and fine-tune the models for accuracy.

4. **Future Improvements**: 
   - Explore advanced techniques like large language models.
   - Develop a user interface for researchers to explore predictions interactively.
